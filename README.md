# Predicting Income with Random Forests

## Introduction
This project aims to use a Random Forest classifier to predict whether individuals earn more than $50,000 per year. The analysis is based on census data obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various census information such as age, education, occupation, and more. Each record represents an individual and indicates whether their income exceeds $50,000.

## Objective
The primary objective is to train a Random Forest model on this dataset and to evaluate its performance in accurately predicting an individual's income category.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- 
## Results
In this project, we employed a Random Forest Classifier, and after training our model with the provided census dataset, the Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of approximately 85%.
